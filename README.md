# Introduction #
For this analysis, we looked at datapoints from the use of Citi Bikes in New York City for the month of August 2019. The purpose of our reporting is to show possible investors in a similar project in the Des Moines, IA area what they might see in terms of ridership. The month of August was specifically chosen to show what might be expected in a season of high ridership, as weather conditions in the winter are not conducive to bike travel.

## Findings ##

We looked at average trip lengths, a heatmap of most popular use times and days, how many of our users are customers and how many are subscribers. We looked at these numbers both overall as well as by gender. Most user rides were less than 10 minutes, and this was consistent between genders. Our heatmap of use times showed that our use pattern mirrors what we see with normal ‘rush hours’ in a city – a spike in the morning, a lull in midday and then another spike in the early evening. This is also consistent across genders. We looked at the genders of our riders and found that approximately one quarter were female. Persons without an identified gender made up about one eighth of our users and the rest (a majority) were male. To get an idea of the use pattern among subscribers and pay per use riders, I did further investigation into that breakdown by gender as well as the frequency of use by gender and user type. I found that a vast majority of both male and female users were subscribers, while the majority of those with a gender not provided were single use customers. 


## Further investigation ##

One consideration that cannot be overlooked is the relative population of the two cities. The borough of Manhattan, one of five that make up New York City, has a population of approx. 1.6 million. Des Moines has a population of approx. 215,000. I would want to see side by side bar charts of the two cities broken down by gender. I would also appreciate a comparative breakdown of the percentage of roads in each city that are considered ‘bike friendly’.
